# Image-Recognition-Based-Passcode-Lock-Contactless-
A Deep Learning based project which is used to reduce contact with the surfaces.<br>
# Working Methodology
•	Image Recognition: - The first step is to detect the hand gesture and classify it whether it is 0,1,2,3,4 or 5.
•	Transfer Data: - After predicting the digit, the output is sent to the Arduino and it get displayed on the LCD screen.
•	Passcode check: - The first two steps are repeated 4 times as the passcode is of 4 digits and after that passcode is verified with the given passcode and accordingly other components will work.
# Software Part of the project: -
•	Programming Language: Python, Embedded C
•	Arduino IDE is used for the coding of Arduino
# Electronic component used are: - 
•	Arduino UNO
•	Servo motor
•	16x2 LCD Screen
•	I2C Module
